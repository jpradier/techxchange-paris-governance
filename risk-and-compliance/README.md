# Introduction

## 👋 Meet Jose – The Chief Risk Officer

Jose works at **TechCorp Inc.**, a large multinational enterprise using AI to improve HR processes like hiring and employee planning.

But there was a problem...  
AI was everywhere, but **nobody really knew**:
- Who built what
- Whether the models were fair and safe
- Whether they complied to regulations like EU AI Act, etc.
- What to do when something went wrong

Jose was responsible for managing all that risk — but he had **no clear way** to do it.

So, Jose and his team decided to leverage **watsonx.governance** to make AI governance easy, clear, and reliable and to easy the collaborate with all the stakeholders, including Maria, the AI engineer.


## 🎯 What Jose Wanted to Fix

Jose didn’t want to manage critical governance processes through spreadsheets, emails or slack messages. 

He wanted a simple system that would:

- ✅ **Track every AI model from start to finish**
- ✅ **Make sure models follow the rules (like GDPR, EU AI Act, etc.)**
- ✅ **Foster collaboration with the development team — without slowing them down**
- ✅ **Catch problems early and fix them fast**
- ✅ **Keep everything ready for audits**

And that’s where **watsonx.governance** helps.



## 👥 Who's involved in AI Governance?

AI Governance is a teams sport involving different roles in an organization. Though it's not uncommon to find scenarios where folks could perform the roles of severals personas, here's what these roles might look like:

*Note:* For simplicy, your single user will impersonate all those personas during the Bootcamp Lab.

## 🚀 The AI Governance Journey in 7 steps (Used by Jose’s Team)

A simple, structured process for managing AI models from idea to remediation.

<strong>⚠️ Note:</strong> In the context of this TechXchange, you will be running through only <strong>step 1 and 2</strong>. The other steps are here for you to explore and understand the end-to-end process, but you won't be required to complete them during the lab. Please feel free to explore the guides for each of the steps in the <a href="./guides-directory.md">Guide directory</a> to learn more about the end-to-end governance process and how watsonx.governance supports each of these steps.

## 💬 What Jose Says Now

> _“Before watsonx.governance, we had no clear process. Now everyone knows what to do, models are better, and we’re always ready for audits.”_

At the end of each guides, you will find a [link](./guides-directory.md) to that guide's directory.
You can also follow along this main guide (to get you started !): 

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Login to [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com) and select the account provided by the instructor.
2. Navigate to **Resource List > AI / Machine Learning**
3. Launch the **OpenPages** instance from the list.   
*If you receive an authorization error, add **/app/jspview/react/grc/dashboard/Home** to the end of the URL.*

<!--
> ![OpenPages Launch](hands_on_lab_images/cloud_openpages.png)
-->

> [!Important]
> After logging make sure to check in Profile that it has to be set as **Watsonx governance MRG Master**:

<img width="972" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 at 3 47 43 PM" src="./assets/hands_on_lab_images/Profile.png">

In this lab, you will impersonate all the users. We haven't created a profile for each of the personnas. You are indeed accessing a vanilla OpenPages with the MRG application provisionned on it. This comes with a collection of default profiles. The Profiles **watsonx governance MRG Master** will enable you to run through all the labs without having to switch profiles or users.

> 🔐 **Note:** Make sure you're logged in as the appropriate role before proceeding with assigned tasks.



## 👩‍💼 Step 1 - Use Case Owner Responsibilities

As a UseCase Owner, your responsibilities include:

* Defining the use case (AskHR - Agentic AI)
* Submitting associated risks for assessment  

🔍 Follow these guides:

* [Creating and defining an AI use case](./steps/step1/usecase-creation-model-owner.md)

Once the guides above have been completed, the Use Case Owner would wait for steps 2-6 to be completed by other roles (development and deployment) up until an incident or issue is reported.
In our scenario, one issue will arise once the model in in production.  


💡 Don’t forget to fill in the **Risk Level** and **Control Details** before submission.


## 👤 Step 2 - Risk & Compliance Officer Responsibilities

As a Business Owner, you play a crucial role with the stakeholder endorsement. Your input ensures the use case aligns with business strategy and acceptable risk levels.

But, prior to your endorsement, a Risk & Compliance Officer would have reviewed and assessed the risks associated with the use case.

🗂️ Follow these guides:

* [Reviewing and Assessing Risk](./steps/step1/risk-review-rco.md) 
* [Stakeholder Risk Endorsement](./steps/step2/risk-endorsement-bul.md)


## 👨‍💻 Step 3 - Model Developer Responsibilities

As a Model Developer, your responsibilities focus on creating and evaluating Prompts and Agents for generative AI use cases. You will build and test these artifacts in the Prompt Lab and Agent Lab. Upon creation, a Factsheet is automatically generated and linked to the Use Case in Watsonx.governance.

You are responsible for completing any required details in the factsheet and submitting it for governance approval.


🗂️ Reference:

* [Model Developer Tasks and Guidelines](./steps/step3/model-developer-tasks.md)


## 🔍 Step 4 - Model Validator Responsibilities

As a **Model Validator**, you are responsible for validating the AI System development including  validating the AI model’s performance and hallucinations metrics. You will reviewing every aspect  to ensure the AI System meets governance standards.

🗂️ Reference:

* [Model Validator Tasks and Guidelines](./steps/step4/model-validator-tasks.md)

  
## 🔍 Step 5 - AIOps Engineer Responsibilities

As a **AIOps Engineer**, you are responsible for Deploying and Monitoring the AI use case/model on **IBM Watsonx Governance** .


🗂️ For detailed steps, refer to:

* [Operations Team Tasks and Evaluation Guide](./steps/step5/model-deployer-tasks.md)


## 🔍 Step 6 - Risk & Compliance Officer Responsibilities

As a **Risk & Compliance Officer**, you are also responsible for reviewing incident and issue that may arise along all the lifecyle of a model. In that scenario, an issue arises while the model is in production. Your task is to review the issue and mitigate.

* [Mitigating Incidents](./steps/step6/mitigating-incidents.md)

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You've helped ensure this Agentic AI use case adheres to ethical AI practices by:

* Validating risk levels
* Confirming regulatory and internal compliance
* Approving only well-governed use cases
* Ensuring model fairness and quality through continuous validation

> 🛡️ Governance is not a one-time check — it’s a continuous loop of accountability and alignment.
